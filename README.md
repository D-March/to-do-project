A web app which works as a to do application.

A user can add, cross out or delete tasks from the to do list. 
A sample of tasks are entered as default to test functionality.
The text area to enter tasks can be hidden by clicking the button on the right of the title.

As the app does not have a back end to store tasks the session resets when the page is refreshed.

There are no prequsities or installation required to use this!
